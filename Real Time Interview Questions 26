First MLOps interview Questions:

Can you briefly introduce yourself and explain your background relevant to DevOps/MLOps?
How do you set up infrastructure for deploying ML models using Terraform?
How do you manage and version Docker images stored in Amazon ECR?
Apart from SageMaker, which AWS or open-source services have you used or are aware of for training ML models?
If batch jobs are running for ML workloads, how do you handle deployments without impacting ongoing processing?
How do you design and implement a complete CI/CD pipeline for ML models?
How do you prevent misuse or unauthorized usage if someone attempts to spin up ML services in AWS?
What strategies do you use to optimize and control AWS costs for ML workloads?
How do you set up monitoring and observability for ML models in production?
You are given a GitHub Actions workflow snippet. How would you identify incorrect steps and suggest improvements or missing steps for a robust CI/CD pipeline?

How would you design a Kubernetes cluster that must survive a full AZ failure without data loss, while running stateful workloads at scale?
(Storage, networking, controllers, quorum, recovery)
Explain the complete request flow when using Gateway API with multiple GatewayClasses across regions. How do you prevent split-brain routing?

How do you debug intermittent pod restarts when liveness probes pass, readiness passes, but the pod is still killed by the node?

What happens internally when etcd latency spikes above 500ms? How does it impact the scheduler, controllers, and API server?

Design a multi-tenant Kubernetes platform where teams must not affect each other’s resource usage, network traffic, or upgrade cycles.

How would you implement zero-trust networking inside Kubernetes without using a service mesh?

Describe a real production incident where a misconfigured HPA caused cascading failure. How would you redesign autoscaling to avoid this?

How do you safely refactor a Terraform monorepo with hundredsgg of state files into a module-based architecture without downtime?

Explain how Terraform handles dependency graphs internally. How can circular dependencies still appear in real projects?

How would you manage Terraform when multiple teams deploy to the same AWS account but must not overwrite each other’s resources?

Describe a production failure caused by terraform apply. What guardrails would you implement to prevent it permanently?

Why does a container sometimes exit immediately even though the application works perfectly in local testing? Give 3 real production causes.

How would you design container images for ultra-fast cold starts in serverless or autoscaled Kubernetes environments?
How do you design GitOps for 1000+ clusters with environment drift detection, emergency hotfixes, and controlled manual overrides?
