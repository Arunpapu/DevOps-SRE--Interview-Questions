All the questions are scenario-based and counter questions. - I have remembered these question , all the counter questions into CICD related and Kubernets.
----------------*----------------*----------------------*--------------------
1. Can you explain what CI/CD is and describe how you have implemented CI/CD pipelines in one of your projects?
2. How does an AWS CodePipeline differ from a Jenkins pipeline? Can you give an example of when you would choose one over the other?
3. How do you configure your CI/CD pipelines? Can you walk me through the steps you followed to set up a pipeline in a recent project?
4. If you need to deploy an application to both cloud environments and on-premises servers (hybrid environment), how would you design and configure your pipeline to handle this?
5. Where and how do you manage environment variables for your applications in a CI/CD setup?  Can you explain how you write and use them securely?
6. After an application is deployed, what post-deployment steps do you typically perform to ensure everything is running smoothly?
7. Can you explain how you would deploy a Kubernetes application using Jenkins? What plugins or tools would you use?
8. What is the difference between git pull and git clone?
9. Can you describe the difference between git pull and git fetch? When would you use one instead of the other?
10. What is git pull vs. git fetch? What is git merge?
11. Suppose you have two commits. How would you check the differences between them?
12. What are Prometheus and Grafana? Can you explain it ?
13. How do you monitor the health and performance of your Kubernetes pods in a production environment?
14. What is Helm, and why do you prefer to use it for managing Kubernetes applications instead of deploying them normally?
15. Can you describe the main components of a Kubernetes cluster and explain the role each one plays?
16. If you want to use the feature branch instead of the main branch, how will you design the CICD?
17.  If any issue occurred in PIPELINE, who handled the issues, and how do the troubleshoot?
