EPAM DevOps Interview Questions Part-1

1. How would you design a scalable, highly available CI/CD system for microservices across multiple teams?
2. How would you manage cross-region deployments using Terraform in a multi-cloud setup?
3. How do you implement GitOps in a Kubernetes environment?
4. Can you explain how you would create a fully automated blue-green deployment in a Kubernetes-based microservices architecture?
5. How do you design an end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline for a fintech application with strict compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS)?
6. What are some best practices for managing pipeline as code in large, distributed teams?
7. How would you dynamically provision ephemeral environments (dev/test) using pipelines?
8. In a monorepo setup, how do you ensure that only relevant services are built and deployed in a CI/CD pipeline?
9. How do you implement a canary deployment strategy with real-time monitoring rollback in a CI/CD system?
10. How do you manage secrets and config securely at scale in Kubernetes without compromising GitOps workflows?
11. Explain the control plane components of Kubernetes and how you would harden them for production use.
12. How would you scale a Kubernetes cluster horizontally across multiple regions and still ensure zero-downtime upgrades?
13. What is a PodDisruptionBudget and how do you use it in critical workloads?
14. How do you implement and manage network policies in Kubernetes for strict inter-service communication?
15. How would you refactor a legacy Terraform codebase used by multiple teams to follow best practices like DRY and modularity?
16. Explain the internals of how Terraform handles dependencies and graph building during the planning phase.
17. How do you manage and isolate Terraform state files across multiple environments and teams?
18. What's your strategy to prevent and recover from a corrupted or deleted remote backend state file?
19. Have you implemented policy-as-code (e.g., Sentinel, OPA) with Terraform? Give a real use case.
20. How would you implement a centralized logging solution across multiple cloud platforms and environments?
21. What's your approach to securing cloud-native DevOps infrastructure with Identity Federation (e.g., Azure AD + AWS IAM)?
22. How do you set up workload identity federation between GitHub Actions and Google Cloud / Azure securely?
23. How do you ensure cost-efficient auto-scaling of infrastructure in cloud when managing high workloads in CI/CD?
24. Explain a scenario where you had to design a disaster recovery (DR) strategy for DevOps infrastructure.
25. How do you enforce compliance and auditability in your CI/CD processes across global regions (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?
26. What's your strategy for managing container image security across all stages of a DevOps pipeline?
27. How would you integrate runtime threat detection in Kubernetes using tools like Falco or Sysdig?
