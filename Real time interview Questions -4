IBM cloud engineer (3.3 Year exp) -> 01-06-25

All the questions are about scenario-based and counter questions.

1. Tell me about yourself.
2. What are your day-to-day activities?
3. What is Terraform, and how does it work?

4. Where do you run your Terraform code—on your local system or on a specific server in your organization?

( Ans. We never run Terraform directly from local systems for production. All Terraform code is stored in Git, 
and execution happens through a controlled CI/CD platform like Azure DevOps or Terraform Cloud. This ensures version control, RBAC, 
state locking, approvals, and full auditability. Local runs are only used for development or sandbox testing.”)

5. What is a tfstate file?

Ans. (tfstate is Terraform’s source of truth for actual infrastructure. 
It tracks all resources created so Terraform knows what exists and what changes need to be applied. 
It must be stored remotely for safety and collaboration.”)

6. Where do you store the tfstate file in your organization?

Ans.tfstate file should be stored in remote backend. 
Always store it in:
Azure Storage Blob (most common in Azure)
AWS S3 + DynamoDB locking
Google Cloud Storage
Terraform Cloud

7. What does the tfstate file actually do?
Ans. (The tfstate file tells Terraform what it has created, what exists now, and what needs to change.
Without tfstate, Terraform cannot plan or apply changes safely.)

8. Suppose another DevOps engineer on your team has made changes to an instance via the UI, and you then run the terraform plan command. 
What will be the output?

Ans. ( Terraform will show plan with drift changes.
If another engineer changes infrastructure manually in the cloud UI and I run terraform plan, 
Terraform detects drift by comparing the real infrastructure with the state file and code.
The plan will show the differences and propose changes to bring the infrastructure back to 
the desired configuration defined in Terraform code.

9. What do the "+" and "−" symbols mean in the terraform plan output ?

Ans. (A plus sign means Terraform will create a new resource 
      Ex: + aws_instance.web
      (A minus sign means Terraform will destroy/delete a resource.)
       Ex: - aws_security_group.old_sg
A tilde (~) indicates Terraform will update the existing resource, usually modifying some attributes without recreating it.

10. If changes have been made to an instance via the UI and you run terraform apply without first running terraform plan, what will happen?
Will there be an error, and will it still execute?

Ans. (Even if I skip terraform plan, Terraform internally performs a plan during terraform apply. 
It detects the drift caused by UI changes and updates the resource to match the Terraform configuration. 
In short—Terraform will override the manual changes and restore the desired state defined in code.)

11. Suppose you're running an application and a vulnerability occurs, how would you handle it? Briefly explain.

Ans. (I would first assess the vulnerability, then immediately contain the risk by isolating the affected component. Next, 
I patch or update the system, rebuild and redeploy the fixed version, and verify through rescanning. Finally, 
I document the incident and strengthen pipelines and security policies to prevent recurrence.”)

12. If it's a production server and you encounter a vulnerability, what will you do?

Ans. (For a production vulnerability, I first assess severity and immediately contain the risk using temporary controls like FW rules
or isolating components. I follow the incident response process, patch or update through a safe deployment method 
(blue-green/rolling), verify via rescanning, and monitor afterwards.
Finally, I document the RCA and improve preventive security checks.”)

13. If it’s a Python application and a vulnerability is found in production and fixing it may take 6 months, 
what is your approach and solution?
14. Are you following any standards to handle such issues? ( We strictly follow ITIL Process)
15. Have you worked with Ansible?
16. What is Ansible?
17. Can you write a playbook?

18. How do you store credentials in Ansible? ( Ansible vault)

19. Are you following any other approach to store secret credentials securely?
20. How do you store variables in Ansible?
21. How do you debug errors in an Ansible playbook, what is the comamand ?
22. Suppose you want to execute a single command without writing a playbook — what is the command, and how do you write it?
23. What modules have you worked with in Ansible? List their names.

24. How do you deploy your application on AWS? What services do you use?

Ans. I deploy applications on AWS using a CI/CD pipeline (CodePipeline or GitHub Actions). 
I package the application and store it in ECR or S3. Based on application type, 
I deploy either on ECS Fargate, EKS, EC2, Lambda, or Elastic Beanstalk. 
I use VPC, ALB, Auto Scaling, RDS/DynamoDB, Secrets Manager, 
and CloudWatch for security and observability.
Everything is automated using Terraform, and deployments follow Blue/Green or rolling update strategies.”

25. When deploying your application to Amazon EKS, what other services do you use along with it?
26. Have you worked with shell scripting and Python scripting?
27. Where have you used Python in your work? What was the purpose, and what tasks did you perform?
28. Have you worked with any monitoring tools? What tools, and what was your role in using them?

2.i had created an resource manually, how to do you implement it through terraform
3.for each and count difference, provide examples in terraform
4.how do you create an module and how do you refer it in terraform

5.how to handle peak traffic after an launch of new product in web app

Ans. To handle peak traffic after launching a new product, I use horizontal auto-scaling, load balancing. 

6.there are multiple micro services and multiple websites, I want to ensure security how do you handle it 

Ans. ( Through Security groups, Web Application firewall, IAM.VPN etc)

7.what is CSI drivers

Ans. (A CSI driver is a Container Storage Interface driver that connects Kubernetes with external storage systems)
Kubernetes uses CSI drivers for cloud storage like AWS EBS, Azure Disk, and GCP PD. CSI standardizes storage and
lets vendors release new features without modifying Kubernetes.”
Kubernetes → Calls CSI driver → Creates disk → Attaches → Mounts to pod.

8.what is helm template and helm install
9.what is helpers files in helm
10.how do you rotate the secrets in key vault and implement .pfx certificate in application gateway , along with ingress/controller in AKS

11.architecture of Kubernetes 

Ans. ( 1 cluster having 1 master node (Kubeapi, kube scheduler, kube controller, etcd) & Child node ( Kubelet, kube proxy, container engine)

12.what is Service principle in azure – provide an example 
13.there is an backend API, I want securely communicate with other, how do you implement it

14.what is daemonset and statefulset 

Ans. (A DaemonSet ensures that one pod runs on every node)
DaemonSet
“DaemonSet runs one pod per node and is used for node-level services like logging and monitoring agents.”

StatefulSet
“StatefulSet manages stateful applications that require persistent storage, stable identity, and ordered deployments, such as databases.”
DaemonSet = 1 per node
StatefulSet = stable pods + stable storage

15.am having an range of ip address 10.0.0.0/16 , I want to have 10.0.0.0/21 subnets , how will I achieve it terraform , how do use locals word and achieve it
16.crashloopbackoff – what are the setps you will follow to troubleshoot further
17.what are the branching strategies and pipeline creation mechanism 
18.what are the files present inside helm chart 19.what is CNI plugin

Ans.
Helm File structure:
mychart/
│── Chart.yaml
│── values.yaml
│── charts/
│── templates/
│     ├── deployment.yaml
│     ├── service.yaml
│     ├── ingress.yaml
│     ├── _helpers.tpl
│     └── NOTES.txt

CNI = Container Network Interface

A CNI plugin is a networking component that Kubernetes uses to provide networking capabilities to pods.

Why do we need CNI?

Kubernetes does not provide networking by itself.
It depends on external CNI plugins to:
Assign IP addresses to pods
Manage routing
Implement network policies
Provide cluster networking
