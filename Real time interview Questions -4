IBM cloud engineer (3.3 Year exp) -> 01-06-25

All the questions are about scenario-based and counter questions.

1. Tell me about yourself.
2. What are your day-to-day activities?
3. What is Terraform, and how does it work?

4. Where do you run your Terraform code—on your local system or on a specific server in your organization?

( Ans. We never run Terraform directly from local systems for production. All Terraform code is stored in Git, 
and execution happens through a controlled CI/CD platform like Azure DevOps or Terraform Cloud. This ensures version control, RBAC, 
state locking, approvals, and full auditability. Local runs are only used for development or sandbox testing.”)

5. What is a tfstate file?

Ans. (tfstate is Terraform’s source of truth for actual infrastructure. 
It tracks all resources created so Terraform knows what exists and what changes need to be applied. 
It must be stored remotely for safety and collaboration.”)

6. Where do you store the tfstate file in your organization?

Ans.tfstate file should be stored in remote backend. 
Always store it in:
Azure Storage Blob (most common in Azure)
AWS S3 + DynamoDB locking
Google Cloud Storage
Terraform Cloud

7. What does the tfstate file actually do?
Ans. (The tfstate file tells Terraform what it has created, what exists now, and what needs to change.
Without tfstate, Terraform cannot plan or apply changes safely.)

8. Suppose another DevOps engineer on your team has made changes to an instance via the UI, and you then run the terraform plan command. 
What will be the output?

Ans. ( Terraform will show plan with drift changes.
If another engineer changes infrastructure manually in the cloud UI and I run terraform plan, 
Terraform detects drift by comparing the real infrastructure with the state file and code.
The plan will show the differences and propose changes to bring the infrastructure back to 
the desired configuration defined in Terraform code.

9. What do the "+" and "−" symbols mean in the terraform plan output ?

Ans. (A plus sign means Terraform will create a new resource 
      Ex: + aws_instance.web
      (A minus sign means Terraform will destroy/delete a resource.)
       Ex: - aws_security_group.old_sg
A tilde (~) indicates Terraform will update the existing resource, usually modifying some attributes without recreating it.

10. If changes have been made to an instance via the UI and you run terraform apply without first running terraform plan, what will happen?
Will there be an error, and will it still execute?

Ans. (Even if I skip terraform plan, Terraform internally performs a plan during terraform apply. 
It detects the drift caused by UI changes and updates the resource to match the Terraform configuration. 
In short—Terraform will override the manual changes and restore the desired state defined in code.)

11. Suppose you're running an application and a vulnerability occurs, how would you handle it? Briefly explain.

12. If it's a production server and you encounter a vulnerability, what will you do?
13. If it’s a Python application and a vulnerability is found in production and fixing it may take 6 months, 
what is your approach and solution?
14. Are you following any standards to handle such issues?
15. Have you worked with Ansible?
16. What is Ansible?
17. Can you write a playbook?
18. How do you store credentials in Ansible?
19. Are you following any other approach to store secret credentials securely?
20. How do you store variables in Ansible?
21. How do you debug errors in an Ansible playbook, what is the comamand ?
22. Suppose you want to execute a single command without writing a playbook — what is the command, and how do you write it?
23. What modules have you worked with in Ansible? List their names.
24. How do you deploy your application on AWS? What services do you use?
25. When deploying your application to Amazon EKS, what other services do you use along with it?
26. Have you worked with shell scripting and Python scripting?
27. Where have you used Python in your work? What was the purpose, and what tasks did you perform?
28. Have you worked with any monitoring tools? What tools, and what was your role in using them?
