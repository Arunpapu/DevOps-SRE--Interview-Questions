Docker:
I can able to get access application from outside container but from inside getting packet loss. How do you trobleshoot. ( Issue related to container networking , firewall rules, DNS)
How do you get logs from docker level. ( By running command - docker logs container id.) 
Two containers are there. One with front end application and second container has db.Fisrt I want to start db then front end. What should you do?( 2tier application)

Kubernetes:
How do you call pod1 to pod2 without service. ( Using pod ip directly ,http://<pod2-ip>:<port>, to get pod 2 ip - docker get pods -o -wide) 

2.what is Container Network Interface ? (Assigning an IP address to a container, Every container/pod needs its own network interface and IP.
CNI handles:IP allocation & Interface creation)

3.what is CSI driver? (A CSI Driver (Container Storage Interface Driver) is a standard plugin that allows Kubernetes (and other container orchestration systems) 
to connect to external storage systems such as: AWS EBS , NFS etc)

4.Static volume provisioning and dynamic volume provisioning. Explain in with use case. (the admin manually create the PersistentVolume (PV) before a workload uses it.
USE Case (Pre-existing NFS, iSCSI, SAN storage, Migration from legacy systems, When storage must be manually controlled)

Dynamic volume provisioning -( We create only a PersistentVolume Claim (PVC).
Use Cases :Cloud storage (AWS EBS, GCP PD, Azure Disk), Highly scalable workloads, On-demand volumes

5.what is auto volume expansion. (Auto Volume Expansion = Automatically grow your storage when PVC size increases.
It is a Kubernetes feature that allows a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to automatically increase its storage size without recreating the PVC or restarting the Pod.)

what is land job activity in migration ? (A scheduled activity that loads (or lands) data from the source system into a temporary/staging layer in the target environment.)

2.what type of basic azure services u will consider ?

4.Hub and Spoke topology 

5.day to day actives what type of work ur doing is it a support/project 

6.what type of pipelines ur handling basically it means QA ,UAT ? (I work with end-to-end CI/CD pipelines across multiple environments — DEV, QA, UAT, Staging, and Production.
The pipelines include building the application, containerizing it, running automated tests, scanning for vulnerabilities, and deploying to Kubernetes.
QA pipelines run integration and regression tests, UAT pipelines involve manual approvals for stakeholder validation, 
and production pipelines include automated rollback and monitoring.”

7. how many team members are there?

8. How about the deployment , IAAS model or Saas  model ? (IAAS Model - You get virtualized infrastructure (VMs, storage, network) and are responsible 
for installing, configuring, and managing the OS, runtime, and applications.
Examples:
AWS EC2
Azure VMs
Google Compute Engine

9.pick one requirement and u deployed end to end by using azure services ?

Automated tests run on QA/UAT environment before production


10. suppose there is a dotnet application which is basically a 3 -tier application ,for webapi deploymment 
i hvae used azure appservices, for background jobs i have used function apps ,and for messaging i have used servicebus and how about the connectivity to all thses?

11.how on-premisis user has to access the application/access the code which was deployed in cloud service . how my connectivity will be configured ( on-premiss to cloud )
? 
-> on‑premises environment needs secure access to applications or code deployed in the cloud)
On‑prem users connect via HTTPS (or other protocols) over the internet to the cloud service endpoint.
Configuration:
Expose the application with a public DNS name.
Secure with TLS/SSL certificates.
Use authentication (OAuth, SAML, or cloud IAM) & VPN

12.IN general as azure specalist from ur side what is ur recomendation is it a sit-to-site vpn or Expressroute

13.lets assume consider banking sector only i dont have that much budget but since ur telling that for low budget go for site-to-site-vpn 
but on otherside ur saying that express-route is more secure > So how can u justy that, because banking costumer has a limitation for him

14.IN which senario we will go for site-to-site vpn  and Expressroute ?
Site-to-Site VPN - (A Site-to-Site VPN connects your on-premises network to AWS over the public Internet using an IPsec VPN tunnel)
Use Cases
Quick, low-cost connectivity to AWS
Non-latency-sensitive workloads
Backup, development, or test environments
Small-scale production workloads where moderate bandwidth is enough

ExpressRoute:
ExpressRoute provides a private, dedicated connection between your on-premises network and Azure, bypassing the Internet.
Use Cases
Mission-critical production workloads
High-performance applications (ERP, databases, SAP, SAP HANA)

15.any storage related components have u worked on?

16. lets say i have a condition i need to access the data which is stored in storage account but that is huge data which is comming from enduser perspective lets say some cppotency that is recording 24/7 and data will be stored but at the same time if anyone comes and to retrieve the data obviously they will get it from storage account,now i need to implement some cost optimisation techniques on storage account to reduce cose because data to be incresed daytoday ?whta afre the possible ways 
with respective storageaccount

16.suppose u have created a storage accouunt with hot-tier is it possible to change to cool-tier ( Yes, we can, from standard to Glacier and other storage class as well using
routing policies)

17. manually we can change from hottier to cool tier ,but when i have huge data it will take time right .\

18.Did u face  any challenges while ur taking backup? any issues 

19. what type of services ur have used for backup .is it azure specific or any on-premisis? 
AWS Backup
Purpose: Centralized backup service for AWS resources.
Services Covered:
EC2 volumes (EBS snapshots)
RDS databases
DynamoDB tables
EFS file systems

20.what are the senarios u configured for DR?

21.how about the monitoring techniques like any alerts we can ?
Tools / Services:
AWS: CloudWatch, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs
On-Premises: Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana
Metrics to monitor: CPU, memory, disk, network bandwidth, uptime

22.lets assume we got an requirement that we have a production infra running on azure cloud and we need to setup an alert mechanism where there 
some thresold values given by customers but considering huge infra but ur getting hundreds of alerts ,in that alert how can u segregate  
that we need to findout ,which alert we need to proporitise ,any appriach u have ?

23.Any known issues u encountered any pipeline is integrated/ any production code is ur pushing or production any known issue and tell which is critical and how u got resolved 
1️⃣ Issue Encountered
During production deployment, one of the services failed to start after the new container image was deployed.
Error observed: CrashLoopBackOff in Kubernetes pods.
Logs showed missing environment variables and database connection timeout.
Impact: Service downtime, affected 10% of production traffic, critical for user-facing functionality.

2️⃣ Analysis & Root Cause
Root cause analysis included:
Reviewing Kubernetes pod logs and events
Checking pipeline logs and deployment scripts
Validating ConfigMaps and Secrets
Found that:
A new environment variable required by the service was missing in production ConfigMap.
Deployment pipeline did not validate presence of required secrets/configs before pushing.

3️⃣ Resolution

Immediate Fix:
Added the missing environment variable in production ConfigMap
Redeployed the pods → service came up successfully
Preventive Measures:
Updated the CI/CD pipeline to validate required environment variables and secrets before deployment
Added pre-deployment integration tests in a staging environment to catch such configuration issues
Implemented alerting on pod CrashLoopBackOff via Azure Monitor / Prometheus so any future failures trigger immediate notifications

24. Have u done any migration form on-premis to azure / from azure to azure with any scenarion and what shot of migrarion s it resource migration or data migration 
25.what are the prechecks u have to consider before migration ? (Check CPU, memory, storage requirements, Ensure network connectivity between source and target,
Check available disk space, )
